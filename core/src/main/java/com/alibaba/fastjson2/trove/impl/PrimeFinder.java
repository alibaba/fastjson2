 *
 * <p>However, JDK 1.2, JGL 3.1 and many other toolkits do nothing to
 * keep capacities prime.  This class provides efficient means to

     * The prime number list consists of 11 chunks.
     *
     * Each chunk contains prime numbers.
     *
     * A chunk starts with a prime P1. The next element is a prime
     * P2. P2 is the smallest prime for which holds: P2 >= 2*P1.
     *
     * The next element is P3, for which the same holds with respect
     * to P2, and so on.
     *
     * Chunks are chosen such that for any desired capacity >= 1000
     * the list includes a prime number <= desired capacity * 1.11.
     *
     * Therefore, primes can be retrieved which are quite close to any
     * desired capacity, which in turn avoids wasting memory.
     *
     * For example, the list includes
     * 1039,1117,1201,1277,1361,1439,1523,1597,1759,1907,2081.
     *
     * So if you need a prime >= 1040, you will find a prime <=
     * 1040*1.11=1154.
     *
     * Chunks are chosen such that they are optimized for a hashtable
     * growthfactor of 2.0;
     *
     * If your hashtable has such a growthfactor then, after initially
     * "rounding to a prime" upon hashtable construction, it will
     * later expand to prime capacities such that there exist no
     * better primes.
     *
     * In total these are about 32*10=320 numbers -> 1 KB of static
     * memory needed.
     *
     * If you are stingy, then delete every second or fourth chunk.
